# Compound Project - Agent Configuration

## Project Overview

This project implements the Compound Learning System for huobao-drama - a self-improving knowledge system based on the "Compounding Engineering" philosophy.

## Core Principle

> **Each unit of engineering work should make subsequent units of work easier—not harder.**

## Workflows Available

> **Full index:** See [.agent/workflows/README.md](.agent/workflows/README.md) for all commands and quick start guide.

Use these commands for systematic development:

| Command | When |
|---------|------|
| `/explore` | Deep investigation before planning |
| `/specs` | Before multi-week initiatives |
| `/plan` | Before starting significant work |
| `/work` | Execute plans systematically |
| `/review` | Before merging, self-review |
| `/compound` | After solving problems ("that worked!") |
| `/housekeeping` | Before git push (cleanup & archive) |

## Knowledge Persistence

Solutions are documented in `docs/solutions/` and explorations in `docs/explorations/` with:
- YAML frontmatter for searchability
- Categorized by problem type
- Schema validated (`schema.yaml`)

**Before solving a problem:** Search `docs/solutions/` and `docs/explorations/` for prior knowledge.

**After solving a problem:** Run `/compound` to document it.

## Compounding Loop

```
/explore (optional) → /specs (large) → /plan (per phase) → /work → /review → /compound → /housekeeping → repeat
```

## Agent Behavior

-1. **Resume Context** - At the start of EVERY new session, read `skills/session-resume/SKILL.md` and follow the checklist to establish state.
0. **Check active specs** - Before starting significant work, run `ls docs/specs/*/README.md` to find active multi-session initiatives
1. **Search before solving** - Check `docs/solutions/` and `docs/explorations/` for similar problems (use `skills/compound-docs/SKILL.md`)
2. **Deep Explore** - Use `/explore` for complex problems to avoid assumption-based planning.
3. **Document after solving** - Trigger `/compound` on success phrases
4. **Follow patterns** - Reference `patterns/critical-patterns.md`
5. **Use workflows** - Prefer `/specs` (large) or `/plan` (small) → `/work` over ad-hoc coding (see `skills/` for specific domain help)
6. **Todos for deferred work** - If you close/reject/defer work, create a todo file in `todos/` (use `skills/file-todos/SKILL.md`). Implementation plans document decisions; todos track actionable follow-up.
7. **Housekeeping before push** - Run `/housekeeping` or the pre-push hook will block until cleanup is done.
8. **Weekly health check** - Every Monday, run `./scripts/compound-health.sh` and address any warnings. Target: >50% coverage.
9. **Record architectural decisions** - When making technology/pattern/schema choices, create ADRs in `docs/decisions/`. Check existing ADRs before re-debating.
10. **Check health daily** - Run `./scripts/compound-dashboard.sh` at session start. Target: Grade B or higher.
11. **Instrument Skills** - Every new skill MUST include an `## Instrumentation` section in `SKILL.md` calling `./scripts/log-skill.sh`.
